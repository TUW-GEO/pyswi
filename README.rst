Python package allowing computation of the Soil Water Index from surface soil moisture observations by means of exponential filter.

Description
===========

The package includes the following features:

* SWI time series calculation
* Recursive SWI approach to calculate SWI for a single or a set of T-values in near-real time
    * Recursive *Weighted* calculation of the SWI, allowing for custom weight assignment to individual observations
