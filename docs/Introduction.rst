Introduction
============
Pyswi allows for calculation of Soil Water Index (SWI) from surface soil moisture (SSM) datasets using an exponential filter.
SWI method was originally developed at TU Wien (Wagner et al. 1999; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442579900036X) and later reformulated recursively by Albergel et al. (2008; https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/12/1323/2008/) to allow for production of an operational product in near-real time.

Features
=========
Calculation of SWI from SSM daily images as well as time series, examples enclosed.
